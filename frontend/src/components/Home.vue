        What's the point?

      <hr/>

      <p>
        The purpose of the E-Coin is currently peer recognition (and by E-Corp).
        Thus, when a collaborator makes a gesture to you that is useful to you in your work,
        you can transfer him E-Coins.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, Alice unlocked Bob in his understanding of the latest fashionable framework,
        so to thanks her, Bob transferred her 3 E-Coins.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no grid to know how many E-Coins give for a specific service.
        This choice is personal. Besides, nothing forces you to give E-Coins.

        Blue, Redâ€¦?!
      </h3>

      <hr/>

      <p>
        E-Coin exists in different colors. Currently, only blue and red are available.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <span class="tag is-info">Blue</span> color corresponds to the normal reward given
        to all E-Corp employees.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <span class="tag is-danger">Red</span> color can be obtain when someone gives you some E-Coins.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <span class="tag is-danger">Red</span> are the proof of services you gived to
        E-Corp.
        These are the E-Coins you can be proud of! Including in HR interview ;)
